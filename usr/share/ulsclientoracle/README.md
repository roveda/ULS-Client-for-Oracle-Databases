# ULS Client for Oracle Databases

The ULS Client for Oracle databases is the GPLv3-based agent for gathering runtime metrics 
and status information and logging configuration settings on Oracle database instances 
running on Unix-like operating systems. All gathered data is sent to an ULS server. 
It works for the 9i, 10g, 11g, 12c and 19c (in development) versions of the Oracle RDBMS. 
See www.universal-logging-system.org for more information.
