Creation of 1.0-1 as rpm
Extracted the watch_oracle relevant entries from original CHANGES file.
Splitted up the oracle_tools to 'ULS Client for Oracle Databases' (uls-client-oracle)
and 'Operational Tools for Oracle Databases' (optools-oracle).
The SID-specific .conf file must be sid.conf in /etc/uls/oracle

* Tue Mar 22 2016 Roveda <roveda@universal-logging-system.org>
Made the get_config2() in Misc.pm safe to read files without any sections.
The perl scripts exited when trying to read the initially empty oracle_tools_SID.conf file.

* Mon Mar 21 2016 Roveda <roveda@universal-logging-system.org>
Made the oracle_tools.conf read-only, because non-standard parameters should be
defined in an oracle_tools_SID.conf file. That allows better and more reliable
automatic updates of the oracle_tools.

* Thu Mar 18 2016 Roveda <roveda@universal-logging-system.org>
Changed all .pl to support a second, ORACLE_SID-specific configuration file.
That is the preparation for fully automatic updates of the oracle_tools:
All defaults are defined in oracle_tools.conf, if you need any other settings,
you create an oracle_tools_$ORACLE_SID.conf file which ONLY contains the
deviant sections and parameters (do not forget the section!).

* Thu Sep 24 2015 Roveda <roveda@universal-logging-system.org>
Re-worked the sql command for successful and failed logins in watch_oracle.pl.

* Sun Sep 20 2015 Roveda <roveda@universal-logging-system.org>
